  <para><emphasis role="bold">Introduction</emphasis></para>

  <para>When &name-icinga; receives passive host checks from remote sources (i.e other &name-icinga; instances in distributed or
  failover setups), the host state reported by the remote source may not accurately reflect the state of the host from
  &name-icinga;' view. As distributed and failover monitoring installations are fairly common, it is important to provide a
  mechanism for ensuring accurate host states between different instances of &name-icinga;.</para>

  <para><emphasis role="bold">Different World Views</emphasis></para>

  <para>The image below shows a simplified view of a failover monitoring setup.</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis>&name-icinga;-A</emphasis> is the primary monitoring server, and is actively monitoring all switches and
      routers.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis>&name-icinga;-B</emphasis> and <emphasis>&name-icinga;-C</emphasis> are backup monitoring servers, and are
      receiving passive check results from <emphasis>&name-icinga;-A</emphasis></para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Both <emphasis>Router-C</emphasis> and <emphasis>Router-D</emphasis> have suffered failures and are offline.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>What states are <emphasis>Router-C</emphasis> and <emphasis>Router-D</emphasis> currently in? The answer depends on which
  &name-icinga; instance you ask.</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis>&name-icinga;-A</emphasis> sees <emphasis>Router-D</emphasis> as DOWN and <emphasis>Router-C</emphasis> as
      UNREACHABLE</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis>&name-icinga;-B</emphasis> should see <emphasis>Router-C</emphasis> as DOWN and
      <emphasis>Router-D</emphasis> as UNREACHABLE</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis>&name-icinga;-C</emphasis> should see both routers as being DOWN.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>Each &name-icinga; instance has a different view of the network. The backup monitoring servers should not blindly accept
  passive host states from the primary monitoring server, or they will have incorrect information on the current state of the
  network.</para>

  <para>Without translating passive host check results from the primary monitoring server (<emphasis>&name-icinga;-A</emphasis>),
  <emphasis>&name-icinga;-C</emphasis> would see <emphasis>Router-D</emphasis> as UNREACHABLE, when it is really DOWN based on its
  viewpoint. Similarly, the DOWN/UNREACHABLE states (from the viewpoint of <emphasis>&name-icinga;-A</emphasis>) for
  <emphasis>Router-C</emphasis> and <emphasis>Router-D</emphasis> should be flipped from the viewpoint of
  <emphasis>&name-icinga;-B</emphasis>.</para>

  <note>
    <para>There may be some situations where you do not want &name-icinga; to translate DOWN/UNREACHABLE states from remote
    sources to their "correct" state from the viewpoint of the local &name-icinga; instance. For example, in distributed
    monitoring environments you may want the central &name-icinga; instance to know how distributed instances see their respective
    portions of the network.</para>
  </note>

  <para><emphasis role="bold">Enabling State Translation</emphasis></para>

  <para>By default, &name-icinga; will <emphasis>not</emphasis> automatically translate DOWN/UNREACHABLE states from passive check
  results. You will need to enable this feature if you need and want it.</para>

  <para>The automatic translation of passive host check states is controlled by the <link
  linkend="configmain-translate_passive_host_checks">translate_passive_host_checks</link> variable. Enable it and &name-icinga;
  will automatically translate DOWN and UNREACHABLE states from remote sources to their correct state for the local instance of
  &name-icinga;.</para>
