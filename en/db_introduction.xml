  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>The &name-idoutils; addon is based on &name-ndoutils; originally written by Ethan Galstad, creator of &name-nagios;(R), so the fundamentals apply to
  &name-nagios; as well as to &name-icinga;.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Purpose</title>

    <para>The &name-idoutils; addon is designed to store all configuration and event data from &name-icinga; in a relational database. Storing information
    from &name-icinga; in an RDBMS will allow for quicker retrieval and processing of that data. The &name-icinga;-API relies on that data.</para>

    <para>Until now MySQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL are supported by the addon. Support for other database servers may be added if there is
    sufficient user interest and even more user who are interested in testing.</para>

    <title>Design Overview</title>

    <para>The &name-idoutils; addon was designed to work for users who have:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Single &name-icinga; installations</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Multiple standalone or "vanilla" &name-icinga; installations</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Multiple &name-icinga; installations in distributed, redundant, and/or fail over environments</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Data from each &name-icinga; process (hereafter referred to as "instances") can be stored either in the same database or different
    databases than data from other &name-icinga; instances.</para>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>Although not yet supported, future development should allow for data from any given &name-icinga; instance to be stored in multiple
    databases if desired.</para>

    <title>Instances</title>

    <para>Each &name-icinga; process, whether it is a standalone monitoring server, or part of a distributed, redundant, or fail over monitoring
    setup, is referred to as an "instance". In order to maintain the integrity of stored data, each &name-icinga; instance must be labeled with a
    unique identifier or name.</para>

    <para>You can choose the name of each &name-icinga; instance to suit your needs. For instance, you could choose to name &name-icinga; instances based
    on their geographical location...</para>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>Or you could name &name-icinga; instances based on their purpose...</para>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>How you name &name-icinga; instances is up to you. The key point to remember is that each and every &name-icinga; process must have its own
    unique instance name.</para>

    <para>More information on how instance names come into play will be discussed in the next sections.</para>
