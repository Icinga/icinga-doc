  <title>About &name-icinga;</title>

  <para><emphasis role="bold"><anchor xml:id="whatsicinga" />What is &name-icinga;?</emphasis></para>

  <para>&name-icinga; is a monitoring system checking hosts and services you specify and notifying you when things go wrong and when they
  recover. It runs on multiple &name-linux; distributions (including <link xlink:href="http://fedoraproject.org/">&name-fedora;</link>,
  <link xlink:href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">&name-ubuntu;</link>, and <link xlink:href="http://www.opensuse.org/">&name-opensuse;</link>) as
  well as several Unix platforms (including <link xlink:href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/">&name-solaris;</link> and <link
  xlink:href="http://www.hp.com">&name-hp;</link>). The systems to be monitored can be nearly anything connected to a network.</para>

  <para>Some of the many features of &name-icinga; include:</para>

  <itemizedlist>

    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para><emphasis role="bold"><anchor xml:id="system_requirements" />System requirements</emphasis></para>

  <para>As mentioned above you'll need a machine running &name-linux; or a Unix variant. If there is no precompiled version or if you want
  to compile from source you need a C compiler like gcc. <note>
      <para>Some compilers may not be suitable. That includes the C compiler on HP-UX which is used to compile a new kernel.</para>
    </note>You may also want to have TCP/IP configured as most checks will require access via the network.</para>

  <para>You are not required to use one of the web interfaces included with &name-icinga;. However, if you do decide to use them, you will
  need additional software:</para>

  <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>A Web-Server (preferrably <link xlink:href="http://www.apache.org">&name-apache;</link>)</para>
    </listitem>
