  <title><anchor xml:id="verify_config" />Verifying Your Configuration</title>

  <para>Every time you modify your configuration files, you also have to restart &name-icinga;. It is important to run a sanity
  check on your configuration files because in case of an error &name-icinga; will not be (re)started.</para>

  <para>In order to verify your configuration, run &name-icinga; using the <emphasis role="bold">-v</emphasis> command line
  option:</para>

  <programlisting> /usr/local/icinga/bin/icinga -v /usr/local/icinga/etc/icinga.cfg  </programlisting>

  <para>If you've forgotten to enter some critical data or misconfigured things, &name-icinga; will show a warning or error
  message that should point you to the location of the problem.</para>

  <para>Error messages generally print out the line in the configuration file that seems to be the source of the problem.</para>

  <para>On errors, &name-icinga; will often exit the pre-flight check and return to the command prompt after printing only the
  first error that it has encountered.</para>

  <para>This is done because one error might lead to consecutive errors as the remainder of the configuration data is
  verified.</para>

  <para>If you get any error messages you'll need to go and edit your configuration files to remedy the problem. Warning messages
  can <emphasis>generally</emphasis> be safely ignored, since they are only recommendations and not requirements.</para>

  <para>Once you've verified your configuration files and fixed possible errors you can go ahead with <xref
  linkend="startstop" />.</para>
