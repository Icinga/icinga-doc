13.1. Sample configuration files and definitions
------------------------------------------------

**Introduction**

This section contains the contents of the sample configuration files and
definitions which are part of the source distribution. In case you
installed a package the packager might have decided to remove them or to
put them in a separate package. The documentation refers to these files
so they are located here for reference.
