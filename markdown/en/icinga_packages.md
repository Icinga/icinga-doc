2.8. Icinga Packages for Linux Distributions
--------------------------------------------

Many distributions like Debian, SUSE or Ubuntu provide packages for
Icinga.

**At this point: a big "thank you" to the many helpers who build
packages and bring them to the distributions!**

Here is a list of distributions for which Icinga packages are available:

Note

Each distribution has its own preferences where the parts of Icinga are
installed, so the locations of configuration files, binaries, log files,
etc., deviate from the places mentioned throughout this documentation.
Sometimes this confuses the users.

You will find a (not yet complete) list of the included Icinga packages
per distribution and their specific locations in the filesystem here:

Locations](https://wiki.icinga.org/display/howtos/Package+Specific+Locations)

Furthermore an installation guide for Icinga with IDOUtils for Ubuntu,
RedHat, Debian and SUSE:
