2.12. Monitoring Overview
-------------------------

**Introduction**

Icinga is intended to monitor devices (e.g. server, router, printer, and
other hardware like temperature sensors) and services (processes running
on these devices, metrics, etc.). There are several ways to do that and
different approaches for different devices depending on your needs or
the infrastructure.

general hints on configuration tools, web interfaces, and other addons
which are available for Icinga.
