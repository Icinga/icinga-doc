# LOG FILE
# This is the main log file where service and host events are logged
# in the config file!!!

log_file=@LOGDIR@/icinga.log



# OBJECT CONFIGURATION FILE(S)
# These are the object configuration files in which you define hosts,
# host groups, contacts, contact groups, services, etc.
# Hint: Check the docs/wiki on how to monitor remote hosts with different
# transport methods and plugins

# You can tell Icinga to process all config files (with a .cfg
# extension) in a particular directory recursively by using the
# cfg_dir directive as shown below with conf.d

cfg_dir=@sysconfdir@/conf.d

# or you can split your object definitions across several config files
# in objects/
#
# ATTENTION: do not mix cfg_file and cfg_dir such as
# cfg_file=foo/bar.cfg
# cfg_dir=foo
# this will include bar.cfg 2 times and lead to config verification errors.

# You can specify individual object config files as shown below:
cfg_file=@sysconfdir@/objects/commands.cfg
cfg_file=@sysconfdir@/objects/contacts.cfg
cfg_file=@sysconfdir@/objects/timeperiods.cfg
cfg_file=@sysconfdir@/objects/templates.cfg

# Definitions for monitoring the local (Linux) host

# Definitions for broker modules like idoutils.cfg
cfg_dir=@sysconfdir@/modules



# OBJECT CACHE FILE
# This option determines where object definitions are cached when
# this cache file (rather than looking at the object config files
# directly) in order to prevent inconsistencies that can occur
# when the config files are modified after Icinga starts.
# If you explicitely set it to /dev/null the core will skip writing
# the objects cache file entirely.
# Tip: Use that file to debug your configuration with fully resolved
# objects like the core sees them.

object_cache_file=@STATEDIR@/objects.cache



# PRE-CACHED OBJECT FILE
# This options determines the location of the precached object file.
# If you run Icinga with the -p command line option, it will preprocess
# your object configuration file(s) and write the cached config to this
# object definitions from this precached file, rather than the standard
# object configuration files (see the cfg_file and cfg_dir options above).
# Using a precached object file can speed up the time needed to (re)start
# the Icinga process if you've got a large and/or complex configuration.
# Read the documentation section on optimizing Icinga to find our more
# about how this feature works.

# RESOURCE FILE
# This is an optional resource file that contains $USERx$ macro

# STATUS FILE
# This is where the current status of all monitored services and
# The contents of the status file are deleted every time Icinga

# EMBEDDED PERL INTERPRETER OPTION
# This option determines whether or not the embedded Perl interpreter

# This option can be used to keep unknown macros within the output.
# e.g. check_proc -C $foo$ will remain.
# This was the default in versions older than Icinga 1.8, but now
# the default is to remove those macros from the output, causing
# the shell to interpret $foo and leaving a single $ there. See

# the old behaviour.

# ENABLE ENVIRONMENT MACROS
# This option determines whether or not Icinga will make all standard
