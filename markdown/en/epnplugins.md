not)](epnplugins.md#todo)

### 11.2.1. Introduction

Stanley Hopcroft has worked with the embedded Perl interpreter quite a
bit and has commented on the advantages/disadvanges of using it. He has
also given several helpful hints on creating Perl plugins that work
properly with the embedded interpreter. The majority of this
documentation comes from his comments.

It should be noted that "ePN", as used in this documentation, refers to
embedded Perl Nagios, or if you prefer, Icinga compiled with an embedded
Perl interpreter.
