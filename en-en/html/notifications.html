  <p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/objects-contacts.png"></span></p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></p>

  <p>I've had a lot of questions as to exactly how notifications work. This will attempt to explain exactly when and how host
  and service notifications are sent out, as well as who receives them.</p>

  <p>Notification escalations are explained <a class="link" href="escalations.html" title="Notification Escalations">here</a>.</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>When Do Notifications Occur?</strong></span></p>

  <p>The decision to send out notifications is made in the service check and host check logic. Host and service notifications
  occur in the following instances...</p>

  <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
      <p>When a hard state change occurs. More information on state types and hard state changes can be found <a class="link" href="statetypes.html" title="State Types">here</a>.</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>When a host or service remains in a hard non-OK state and the time specified by the
      &lt;<span class="emphasis"><em>notification_interval</em></span>&gt; option in the host or service definition has passed since the last
      notification was sent out (for that specified host or service).</p>
    </li>
</ul></div>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Who Gets Notified?</strong></span></p>

  <p>Each host and service definition has a &lt;<span class="emphasis"><em>contact_groups</em></span>&gt; option that specifies what contact
  groups receive notifications for that particular host or service. Contact groups can contain one or more individual
  contacts.</p>

  <p>When Icinga sends out a host or service notification, it will notify each contact that is a member of any contact
  groups specified in the &lt;<span class="emphasis"><em>contactgroups</em></span>&gt; option of the service definition. Icinga realizes that
  a contact may be a member of more than one contact group, so it removes duplicate contact notifications before it does
  anything.</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>What Filters Must Be Passed In Order For Notifications To Be Sent?</strong></span></p>

  <p>Just because there is a need to send out a host or service notification doesn't mean that any contacts are going to get
  notified. There are several filters that potential notifications must pass before they are deemed worthy enough to be sent out.
  Even then, specific contacts may not be notified if their notification filters do not allow for the notification to be sent to
  them. Let's go into the filters that have to be passed in more detail...</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Program-Wide Filter:</strong></span></p>

  <p>The first filter that notifications must pass is a test of whether or not notifications are enabled on a program-wide
  basis. This is initially determined by the <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-enable_notifications">enable_notifications</a> directive
  in the main config file, but may be changed during runtime from the web interface. If notifications are disabled on a
  program-wide basis, no host or service notifications can be sent out - period. If they are enabled on a program-wide basis,
  there are still other tests that must be passed...</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Service and Host Filters:</strong></span></p>

  <p>The first filter for host or service notifications is a check to see if the host or service is in a period of <a class="link" href="downtime.html" title="Scheduled Downtime">scheduled downtime</a>. It it is in a scheduled downtime, <span class="bold"><strong>no one gets
  notified</strong></span>. If it isn't in a period of downtime, it gets passed on to the next filter. As a side note, notifications
  for services are suppressed if the host they're associated with is in a period of scheduled downtime.</p>

  <p>The second filter for host or service notification is a check to see if the host or service is <a class="link" href="flapping.html" title="Detection and Handling of State Flapping">flapping</a> (if you enabled flap detection). If the service or host is currently flapping, <span class="bold"><strong>no one gets notified</strong></span>. Otherwise it gets passed to the next filter.</p>

  <p>The third host or service filter that must be passed is the host- or service-specific notification options. Each service
  definition contains options that determine whether or not notifications can be sent out for warning states, critical states, and
  recoveries. Similiarly, each host definition contains options that determine whether or not notifications can be sent out when
  the host goes down, becomes unreachable, or recovers. If the host or service notification does not pass these options, <span class="bold"><strong>no one gets notified</strong></span>. If it does pass these options, the notification gets passed to the next
  filter...</p>

  <div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note">
<tr>
<td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></td>
<th align="left">Note</th>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">
    <p>Notifications about host or service recoveries are only sent out if a notification was sent out for the original
    problem. It doesn't make sense to get a recovery notification for something you never knew was a problem.</p>
  </td></tr>
</table></div>

  <p>The fourth host or service filter that must be passed is the time period test. Each host and service definition has a
  &lt;<span class="emphasis"><em>notification_period</em></span>&gt; option that specifies which time period contains valid notification times for
  the host or service. If the time that the notification is being made does not fall within a valid time range in the specified
  time period, <span class="bold"><strong>no one gets contacted</strong></span>. If it falls within a valid time range, the notification
  gets passed to the next filter...</p>

  <div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note">
<tr>
<td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></td>
<th align="left">Note</th>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">
    <p>If the time period filter is not passed, Icinga will reschedule the next notification for the host or service (if
    its in a non-OK state) for the next valid time present in the time period. This helps ensure that contacts are notified of
    problems as soon as possible when the next valid time in time period arrives.</p>
  </td></tr>
</table></div>

  <p>The last set of host or service filters is conditional upon two things: (1) a notification was already sent out about a
  problem with the host or service at some point in the past and (2) the host or service has remained in the same non-OK state
  that it was when the last notification went out. If these two criteria are met, then Icinga will check and make sure the
  time that has passed since the last notification went out either meets or exceeds the value specified by the
  &lt;<span class="emphasis"><em>notification_interval</em></span>&gt; option in the host or service definition. If not enough time has passed since
  the last notification, <span class="bold"><strong>no one gets contacted</strong></span>. If either enough time has passed since the last
  notification or the two criteria for this filter were not met, the notification will be sent out! Whether or not it actually is
  sent to individual contacts is up to another set of filters...</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Contact Filters:</strong></span></p>

  <p>At this point the notification has passed the program mode filter and all host or service filters and Icinga starts
  to notify <a class="link" href="objectdefinitions.html#objectdefinitions-contact">all the people it should</a>. Does this mean that each contact is going
  to receive the notification? No! Each contact has their own set of filters that the notification must pass before they receive
  it.</p>

  <div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note">
<tr>
<td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></td>
<th align="left">Note</th>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">
    <p>Contact filters are specific to each contact and do not affect whether or not other contacts receive
    notifications.</p>
  </td></tr>
</table></div>

  <p>The first filter that must be passed for each contact are the notification options. Each contact definition contains
  options that determine whether or not service notifications can be sent out for warning states, critical states, and recoveries.
  Each contact definition also contains options that determine whether or not host notifications can be sent out when the host
  goes down, becomes unreachable, or recovers. If the host or service notification does not pass these options, <span class="bold"><strong>the contact will not be notified</strong></span>. If it does pass these options, the notification gets passed to the next
  filter...</p>

  <div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note">
<tr>
<td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></td>
<th align="left">Note</th>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">
    <p>Notifications about host or service recoveries are only sent out if a notification was sent out for the original
    problem. It doesn't make sense to get a recovery notification for something you never knew was a problem...</p>
  </td></tr>
</table></div>

  <p>The last filter that must be passed for each contact is the time period test. Each contact definition has a
  &lt;<span class="emphasis"><em>notification_period</em></span>&gt; option that specifies which time period contains valid notification times for
  the contact. If the time that the notification is being made does not fall within a valid time range in the specified time
  period, <span class="bold"><strong>the contact will not be notified</strong></span>. If it falls within a valid time range, the contact
  gets notified!</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Notification Methods</strong></span></p>

  <p>You can have Icinga notify you of problems and recoveries pretty much anyway you want: pager, cellphone, email,
  instant message, audio alert, electric shocker, etc. How notifications are sent depend on the <a class="link" href="objectdefinitions.html#objectdefinitions-command">notification commands</a> that are defined in your <a class="link" href="config.html" title="Configuration Overview">object
  definition files</a>.</p>

  <div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note">
<tr>
<td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></td>
<th align="left">Note</th>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">
    <p>If you install Icinga according to the <a class="link" href="quickstart.html" title="Quickstart Installation Guides">quickstart guide</a>, it should be
    configured to send email notifications. You can see the email notification commands that are used by viewing the contents of
    the following file: <span class="emphasis"><em>/usr/local/icinga/etc/objects/commands.cfg</em></span>.</p>
  </td></tr>
</table></div>

  <p>Specific notification methods (paging, etc.) are not directly incorporated into the Icinga code as it just doesn't
  make much sense. The "core" of Icinga is not designed to be an all-in-one application. If service checks were embedded in
  Icinga' core it would be very difficult for users to add new check methods, modify existing checks, etc. Notifications
  work in a similiar manner. There are a thousand different ways to do notifications and there are already a lot of packages out
  there that handle the dirty work, so why re-invent the wheel and limit yourself to a bike tire? Its much easier to let an
  external entity (i.e. a simple script or a full-blown messaging system) do the messy stuff. Some messaging packages that can
  handle notifications for pagers and cellphones are listed below in the resource section.</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Notification Type Macro</strong></span></p>

  <p>When crafting your notification commands, you need to take into account what type of notification is occurring. The <a class="link" href="macrolist.html#macrolist-notificationtype">$NOTIFICATIONTYPE$</a> macro contains a string that identifies exactly that. The table
  below lists the possible values for the macro and their respective descriptions:</p>

  <div class="informaltable">

<td><p>A service or host has just entered (or is still in) a problem state. If this is a service notification, it
          means the service is either in a WARNING, UNKNOWN or CRITICAL state. If this is a host notification, it means the host
          is in a DOWN or UNREACHABLE state.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>RECOVERY</p></td>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Helpful Resources</strong></span></p>

  <p>There are many ways you could configure Icinga to send notifications out. Its up to you to decide which method(s)
  you want to use. Once you do that you'll have to install any necessary software and configure notification commands in your
  config files before you can use them. Here are just a few possible notification methods:</p>

  <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
      <p>Email</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>Pager</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>Phone (SMS)</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>WinPopup message</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>Yahoo, ICQ, or MSN instant message</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>Audio alerts</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>etc...</p>
    </li>
</ul></div>

  <p>Basically anything you can do from a command line can be tailored for use as a notification command.</p>

  <p>If you're looking for an alternative to using email for sending messages to your pager or cellphone, check out these
  packages. They could be used in conjuction with Icinga to send out a notification via a modem when a problem arises. That
  way you don't have to rely on email to send notifications out (remember, email may *not* work if there are network problems). I
  haven't actually tried these packages myself, but others have reported success using them...</p>

  <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
      <p><a class="link" href="http://www.gnokii.org/" target="_top">Gnokii</a> (SMS software for contacting Nokia phones via GSM
      network)</p>

</ul></div>

  <p>If you want to try out a non-traditional method of notification, you might want to mess around with audio alerts. If you
  want to have audio alerts played on the monitoring server (with synthesized speech), check out <a class="link" href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/" target="_top">Festival</a>. If you'd rather leave the monitoring box alone and
  have audio alerts played on another box, check out the <a class="link" href="http://radscan.com/nas" target="_top">Network Audio System
