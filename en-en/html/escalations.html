  <p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/objects-contacts.png"></span></p>

  <p>Icinga supports optional escalation of contact notifications for hosts and services. Escalation of host and service
  notifications is accomplished by defining <a class="link" href="objectdefinitions.html#objectdefinitions-hostescalation">host escalations</a> and <a class="link" href="objectdefinitions.html#objectdefinitions-serviceescalation">service escalations</a> in your <a class="link" href="configobject.html" title="Object Configuration Overview">object
  configuration file(s)</a>.</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>When Are Notifications Escalated?</strong></span></p>

  <p>Notifications are escalated <span class="emphasis"><em>if and only if</em></span> one or more escalation definitions matches the current
  notification that is being sent out. If a host or service notification <span class="emphasis"><em>does not</em></span> have any valid escalation
  definitions that applies to it, the contact group(s) specified in either the host group or service definition will be used for
  the notification. Look at the example below:</p>

  <pre class="screen"> define serviceescalation{
        host_name               webserver
        service_description     HTTP
        first_notification      3
        last_notification       5
        notification_interval   90
        contact_groups          nt-admins,managers
        }

 define serviceescalation{
        host_name               webserver
        service_description     HTTP
        first_notification      6
        last_notification       10
        notification_interval   60
        contact_groups          nt-admins,managers,everyone
        }</pre>

  <p>Notice that there are "holes" in the notification escalation definitions. In particular, notifications 1 and 2 are not
  handled by the escalations, nor are any notifications beyond 10. For the first and second notification, as well as all
  notifications beyond the tenth one, the <span class="emphasis"><em>default</em></span> contact groups specified in the service definition are
  used. For all the examples we'll be using, we'll be assuming that the default contact groups for the service definition is
  called <span class="emphasis"><em>nt-admins</em></span>.</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Contact Groups</strong></span></p>

  <p>When defining notification escalations, it is important to keep in mind that any contact groups that were members of
  "lower" escalations (i.e. those with lower notification number ranges) should also be included in "higher" escalation
  definitions. This should be done to ensure that anyone who gets notified of a problem <span class="emphasis"><em>continues</em></span> to get
  notified as the problem is escalated. Example:</p>

  <pre class="screen"> define serviceescalation{
        host_name               webserver
        service_description     HTTP
        first_notification      3
        last_notification       5
        notification_interval   90
        contact_groups          nt-admins,managers
        }

 define serviceescalation{
        host_name               webserver
        service_description     HTTP
        first_notification      6
        last_notification       0
        notification_interval   60
        contact_groups          nt-admins,managers,everyone
        }</pre>

  <p>The first (or "lowest") escalation level includes both the <span class="emphasis"><em>nt-admins</em></span> and
  <span class="emphasis"><em>managers</em></span> contact groups. The last (or "highest") escalation level includes the
  <span class="emphasis"><em>nt-admins</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>managers</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>everyone</em></span> contact groups. Notice that the
  <span class="emphasis"><em>nt-admins</em></span> contact group is included in both escalation definitions. This is done so that they continue to
  get paged if there are still problems after the first two service notifications are sent out. The <span class="emphasis"><em>managers</em></span>
  contact group first appears in the "lower" escalation definition - they are first notified when the third problem notification
  gets sent out. We want the <span class="emphasis"><em>managers</em></span> group to continue to be notified if the problem continues past five
  notifications, so they are also included in the "higher" escalation definition.</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Overlapping Escalation Ranges</strong></span></p>

  <p>Notification escalation definitions can have notification ranges that overlap. Take the following example:</p>

  <pre class="screen"> define serviceescalation{
        host_name               webserver
        service_description     HTTP
        first_notification      3
        last_notification       5
        notification_interval   20
        contact_groups          nt-admins,managers
        }

 define serviceescalation{
        host_name               webserver
        service_description     HTTP
        first_notification      4
        last_notification       0
        notification_interval   30
        contact_groups          on-call-support
        }</pre>

  <p>In the example above:</p>

  <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
      <p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>nt-admins</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>managers</em></span> contact groups get notified on the third
      notification</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>All three contact groups get notified on the fourth and fifth notifications</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>Only the <span class="emphasis"><em>on-call-support</em></span> contact group gets notified on the sixth (or higher) notification</p>
    </li>
</ul></div>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Recovery Notifications</strong></span></p>

  <p>Recovery notifications are slightly different than problem notifications when it comes to escalations. Take the following
  example:</p>

  <pre class="screen"> define serviceescalation{
        host_name               webserver
        service_description     HTTP
        first_notification      3
        last_notification       5
        notification_interval   20
        contact_groups          nt-admins,managers
        }

 define serviceescalation{
        host_name               webserver
        service_description     HTTP
        first_notification      4
        last_notification       0
        notification_interval   30
        contact_groups          on-call-support
        }</pre>

  <p>If, after three problem notifications, a recovery notification is sent out for the service, who gets notified? The
  recovery is actually the fourth notification that gets sent out. However, the escalation code is smart enough to realize that
  only those people who were notified about the problem on the third notification should be notified about the recovery. In this
  case, the <span class="emphasis"><em>nt-admins</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>managers</em></span> contact groups would be notified of the
  recovery.</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Notification Intervals</strong></span></p>

  <p>You can change the frequency at which escalated notifications are sent out for a particular host or service by using the
  <span class="emphasis"><em>notification_interval</em></span> option of the hostgroup or service escalation definition. Example:</p>

  <pre class="screen"> define serviceescalation{
        host_name               webserver
        service_description     HTTP
        first_notification      3
        last_notification       5
        notification_interval   45
        contact_groups          nt-admins,managers
        }

 define serviceescalation{
        host_name               webserver
        service_description     HTTP
        first_notification      6
        last_notification       0
        notification_interval   60
        contact_groups          nt-admins,managers,everyone
        }</pre>

  <p>In this example we see that the default notification interval for the services is 240 minutes (this is the value in the
  service definition). When the service notification is escalated on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th notifications, an interval of 45
  minutes will be used between notifications. On the 6th and subsequent notifications, the notification interval will be 60
  minutes, as specified in the second escalation definition.</p>

  <p>Since it is possible to have overlapping escalation definitions for a particular hostgroup or service, and the fact that a
  host can be a member of multiple hostgroups, Icinga has to make a decision on what to do as far as the notification
  interval is concerned when escalation definitions overlap. In any case where there are multiple valid escalation definitions for
  a particular notification, Icinga will choose the smallest notification interval. Take the following example:</p>

  <pre class="screen"> define serviceescalation{
        host_name               webserver
        service_description     HTTP
        first_notification      3
        last_notification       5
        notification_interval   45
        contact_groups          nt-admins,managers
        }

 define serviceescalation{
        host_name               webserver
        service_description     HTTP
        first_notification      4
        last_notification       0
        notification_interval   60
        contact_groups          nt-admins,managers,everyone
        }</pre>

  <p>We see that the two escalation definitions overlap on the 4th and 5th notifications. For these notifications,
  Icinga will use a notification interval of 45 minutes, since it is the smallest interval present in any valid escalation
  definitions for those notifications.</p>

  <p>One last note about notification intervals deals with intervals of 0. An interval of 0 means that Icinga should
  only sent a notification out for the first valid notification during that escalation definition. All subsequent notifications
  for the hostgroup or service will be suppressed. Take this example:</p>

  <pre class="screen">define serviceescalation{
        host_name               webserver
        service_description     HTTP
        first_notification      3
        last_notification       5
        notification_interval   45
        contact_groups          nt-admins,managers
        }

 define serviceescalation{
        host_name               webserver
        service_description     HTTP
        first_notification      4
        last_notification       6
        notification_interval   0
        contact_groups          nt-admins,managers,everyone
        }
        
 define serviceescalation{
        host_name               webserver
        service_description     HTTP
        first_notification      7
        last_notification       0
        notification_interval   30
        contact_groups          nt-admins,managers
        }</pre>

  <p>In the example above, the maximum number of problem notifications that could be sent out about the service would be four.
  This is because the notification interval of 0 in the second escalation definition indicates that only one notification should
  be sent out (starting with and including the 4th notification) and all subsequent notifications should be repressed. Because of
  this, the third service escalation definition has no effect whatsoever, as there will never be more than four
  notifications.</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Time Period Restrictions</strong></span></p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, escalations can be used at any time that a notification could normally be sent out for the
  host or service. This "notification time window" is determined by the <span class="emphasis"><em>notification_period</em></span> directive in the
  <a class="link" href="objectdefinitions.html#objectdefinitions-host">host</a> or <a class="link" href="objectdefinitions.html#objectdefinitions-service">service</a>
  definition.</p>

  <p>You can optionally restrict escalations so that they are only used during specific time periods by using the
  <span class="emphasis"><em>escalation_period</em></span> directive in the host or service escalation definition. If you use the
  <span class="emphasis"><em>escalation_period</em></span> directive to specify a <a class="link" href="timeperiods.html" title="Time Periods">timeperiod</a> during which the
  escalation can be used, the escalation will only be used during that time. If you do not specify any
  <span class="emphasis"><em>escalation_period</em></span> directive, the escalation can be used at any time within the "notification time window"
  for the host or service.</p>

  <div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note">
<tr>
<td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></td>
<th align="left">Note</th>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">
    <p>Escalated notifications are still subject to the normal time restrictions imposed by the
    <span class="emphasis"><em>notification_period</em></span> directive in a host or service definition, so the timeperiod you specify in an
    escalation definition should be a subset of that larger "notification time window".</p>
  </td></tr>
</table></div>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>State Restrictions</strong></span></p>

  <p>If you would like to restrict the escalation definition so that it is only used when the host or service is in a
  particular state, you can use the <span class="emphasis"><em>escalation_options</em></span> directive in the host or service escalation
  definition. If you do not use the <span class="emphasis"><em>escalation_options</em></span> directive, the escalation can be used when the host or
  service is in any state.</p>
