  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></p>

  <p>The basic workings of host checks are described here...</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>When Are Host Checks Performed?</strong></span></p>

  <p>Hosts are checked by the Icinga daemon:</p>

  <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
      <p>At regular intervals, as defined by the <span class="emphasis"><em>check_interval</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>retry_interval</em></span>
      options in your <a class="link" href="objectdefinitions.html#objectdefinitions-host">host definitions</a>.</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>On-demand when a service associated with the host changes state.</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>On-demand as needed as part of the <a class="link" href="networkreachability.html" title="Determining Status and Reachability of Network Hosts">host reachability</a> logic.</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>On-demand as needed for <a class="link" href="dependencychecks.html" title="Predictive Dependency Checks">predictive host dependency checks</a>.</p>
    </li>
</ul></div>

  <p>Regularly scheduled host checks are optional. If you set the <span class="emphasis"><em>check_interval</em></span> option in your host
  definition to zero (0), Icinga will not perform checks of the hosts on a regular basis. It will, however, still perform
  on-demand checks of the host as needed for other parts of the monitoring logic.</p>

  <p>On-demand checks are made when a service associated with the host changes state because Icinga needs to know
  whether the host has also changed state. Services that change state are often an indicator that the host may have also changed
  state. For example, if Icinga detects that the HTTP service associated with a host just changed from a CRITICAL to an OK
  state, it may indicate that the host just recovered from a reboot and is now back up and running.</p>

  <p>On-demand checks of hosts are also made as part of the <a class="link" href="networkreachability.html" title="Determining Status and Reachability of Network Hosts">host reachability</a> logic.
  Icinga is designed to detect network outages as quickly as possible, and distinguish between DOWN and UNREACHABLE host
  states. These are very different states and can help an admin quickly locate the cause of a network outage.</p>

  <p>On-demand checks are also performed as part of the <a class="link" href="dependencychecks.html" title="Predictive Dependency Checks">predictive host dependency
  check</a> logic. These checks help ensure that the dependency logic is as accurate as possible.</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Cached Host Checks</strong></span></p>

  <p>The performance of on-demand host checks can be significantly improved by implementing the use of cached checks, which
  allow Icinga to forgo executing a host check if it determines a relatively recent check result will do instead. More
  information on cached checks can be found <a class="link" href="cachedchecks.html" title="Cached Checks">here</a>.</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Dependencies and Checks</strong></span></p>

  <p>You can define <a class="link" href="objectdefinitions.html#objectdefinitions-hostdependency">host execution dependencies</a> that prevent
  Icinga from checking the status of a host depending on the state of one or more other hosts. More information on
  dependencies can be found <a class="link" href="dependencies.html" title="Host and Service Dependencies">here</a>.</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Parallelization of Host Checks</strong></span></p>

  <p>Scheduled host checks are run in parallel. When Icinga needs to run a scheduled host check, it will initiate the
  host check and then return to doing other work (running service checks, etc). The host check runs in a child process that was
  fork()ed from the main Icinga daemon. When the host check has completed, the child process will inform the main
  Icinga process (its parent) of the check results. The main Icinga process then handles the check results and takes
  appropriate action (running event handlers, sending notifications, etc.).</p>

  <p>On-demand host checks are also run in parallel if needed. As mentioned earlier, Icinga can forgo the actual
  execution of an on-demand host check if it can use the cached results from a relatively recent host check.</p>

  <p>When Icinga processes the results of scheduled and on-demand host checks, it may initiate (secondary) checks of
  other hosts. These checks can be initated for two reasons: <a class="link" href="dependencychecks.html" title="Predictive Dependency Checks">predictive dependency checks</a>
  and to determining the status of the host using the <a class="link" href="networkreachability.html" title="Determining Status and Reachability of Network Hosts">network reachability</a> logic. The
  secondary checks that are initiated are usually run in parallel. However, there is one big exception that you should be aware
  of, as it can have negative effect on performance...</p>

    <p>Hosts which have their <span class="emphasis"><em>max_check_attempts</em></span> value set to <span class="bold"><strong>1</strong></span> can cause
    serious performance problems. The reason? If Icinga needs to determine their true state using the <a class="link" href="networkreachability.html" title="Determining Status and Reachability of Network Hosts">network reachability</a> logic (to see if they're DOWN or UNREACHABLE), it will have to
    launch <span class="bold"><strong>serial</strong></span> checks of all of the host's immediate parents. Just to reiterate, those checks
    are run <span class="emphasis"><em>serially</em></span>, rather than in parallel, so it can cause a big performance hit. For this reason, I
    would recommend that you always use a value greater than 1 for the <span class="emphasis"><em>max_check_attempts</em></span> directives in your
    host definitions.</p>

</table></div>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Host States</strong></span></p>

  <p>Hosts that are checked can be in one of three different states:</p>

  <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
      <p>UP</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>DOWN</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>UNREACHABLE</p>
    </li>
</ul></div>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Host State Determination</strong></span></p>

  <p>Host checks are performed by <a class="link" href="plugins.html" title="Icinga Plugins">plugins</a>, which can return a state of OK, WARNING, UNKNOWN, or
  CRITICAL. How does Icinga translate these plugin return codes into host states of UP, DOWN, or UNREACHABLE? Lets
  see...</p>

  <p>The table below shows how plugin return codes correspond with preliminary host states. Some post-processing (which is
  described later) is done which may then alter the final host state.</p>

  <div class="informaltable">
    <table border="1">
<colgroup>
<col>
<col>
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p> <span class="bold"><strong>Plugin Result</strong></span> </p></td>
<td><p> <span class="bold"><strong>Preliminary Host State</strong></span> </p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>OK</p></td>
<td><p>UP</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>WARNING</p></td>
<td><p>UP or DOWN<sup>*</sup></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>UNKNOWN</p></td>
<td><p>DOWN</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>CRITICAL</p></td>
<td><p>DOWN</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
  </div>

  <div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note">
<tr>
<td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></td>
<th align="left">Note</th>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">
    <p>WARNING results usually means the host is UP. However, WARNING results are interpreted to mean the host is DOWN if the
    <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-use_aggressive_host_checking">use_aggressive_host_checking</a> option is enabled.</p>
  </td></tr>
</table></div>

  <p>If the preliminary host state is DOWN, Icinga will attempt to see if the host is really DOWN or if it is
  UNREACHABLE. The distinction between DOWN and UNREACHABLE host states is important, as it allows admins to determine root cause
  of network outages faster. The following table shows how Icinga makes a final state determination based on the state of
  the hosts parent(s). A host's parents are defined in the <span class="emphasis"><em>parents</em></span> directive in host definition.</p>

  <div class="informaltable">
    <table border="1">
<colgroup>
<col>
<col>
<col>
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p> <span class="bold"><strong>Preliminary Host State</strong></span> </p></td>
<td><p> <span class="bold"><strong>Parent Host State</strong></span> </p></td>
<td><p> <span class="bold"><strong>Final Host State</strong></span> </p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>DOWN</p></td>
<td><p>At least one parent is UP</p></td>
<td><p>DOWN</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>DOWN</p></td>
<td><p>All parents are either DOWN or UNREACHABLE</p></td>
<td><p>UNREACHABLE</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
  </div>

  <p>More information on how Icinga distinguishes between DOWN and UNREACHABLE states can be found <a class="link" href="networkreachability.html" title="Determining Status and Reachability of Network Hosts">here</a>.</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Host State Changes</strong></span></p>

  <p>As you are probably well aware, hosts don't always stay in one state. Things break, patches get applied, and servers need
  to be rebooted. When Icinga checks the status of hosts, it will be able to detect when a host changes between UP, DOWN,
  and UNREACHABLE states and take appropriate action. These state changes result in different <a class="link" href="statetypes.html" title="State Types">state
  types</a> (HARD or SOFT), which can trigger <a class="link" href="eventhandlers.html" title="Event Handlers">event handlers</a> to be run and <a class="link" href="notifications.html" title="Notifications">notifications</a> to be sent out. Detecting and dealing with state changes is what Icinga is
  all about.</p>

  <p>When hosts change state too frequently they are considered to be "flapping". A good example of a flapping host would be
  server that keeps spontaneously rebooting as soon as the operating system loads. That's always a fun scenario to have to deal
  with. Icinga can detect when hosts start flapping, and can suppress notifications until flapping stops and the host's
  state stabilizes. More information on the flap detection logic can be found <a class="link" href="flapping.html" title="Detection and Handling of State Flapping">here</a>.</p>
