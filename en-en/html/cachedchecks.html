  <p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/cachedchecks1.png"></span></p>

  <p>The performance of Icinga' monitoring logic can be significantly improved by implementing the use of cached checks.
  Cached checks allow Icinga to forgo executing a host or service check command if it determines a relatively recent check
  result will do instead.</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>For On-Demand Checks Only</strong></span></p>

  <p>Regularly scheduled host and service checks will not see a performance improvement with use of cached checks. Cached
  checks are only useful for improving the performance of on-demand host and service checks. Scheduled checks help to ensure that
  host and service states are updated regularly, which may result in a greater possibility their results can be used as cached
  checks in the future.</p>

  <p>For reference, on-demand host checks occur...</p>

    <p>Unless you make use of service dependencies, Icinga will not be able to use cached check results to improve the
    performance of service checks. Don't worry about that - its normal. Cached host checks are where the big performance
    improvements lie, and everyone should see a benefit there.</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>How Caching Works</strong></span></p>

  <p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/cachedchecks.png"></span></p>

  <p>When Icinga needs to perform an on-demand host or service check, it will make a determination as to whether it can
  used a cached check result or if it needs to perform an actual check by executing a plugin. It does this by checking to see if
  the last check of the host or service occured within the last X minutes, where X is the cached host or service check
  horizon.</p>

  <p>If the last check was performed within the timeframe specified by the cached check horizon variable, Icinga will
  use the result of the last host or service check and will <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> execute a new check. If the host or service
  has not yet been checked, or if the last check falls outside of the cached check horizon timeframe, Icinga will execute a
  new host or service check by running a plugin.</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>What This Really Means</strong></span></p>

  <p>Icinga performs on-demand checks because it need to know the current state of a host or service <span class="emphasis"><em>at that
  exact moment</em></span> in time. Utilizing cached checks allows you to make Icinga think that recent check results are
  "good enough" for determining the current state of hosts, and that it doesn't need to go out and actually re-check the status of
  that host or service.</p>

  <p>The cached check horizon tells Icinga how recent check results must be in order to reliably reflect the current
  state of a host or service. For example, with a cached check horizon of 30 seconds, you are telling Icinga that if a
  host's state was checked sometime in the last 30 seconds, the result of that check should still be considered the current state
  of the host.</p>

  <p>The number of cached check results that Icinga can use versus the number of on-demand checks it has to actually
  execute can be considered the cached check "hit" rate. By increasing the cached check horizon to equal the regular check
  interval of a host, you could theoretically achieve a cache hit rate of 100%. In that case all on-demand checks of that host
  would use cached check results. What a performance improvement! But is it really? Probably not.</p>

  <p>The reliability of cached check result information decreases over time. Higher cache hit rates require that previous check
  results are considered "valid" for longer periods of time. Things can change quickly in any network scenario, and there's no
  guarantee that a server that was functioning properly 30 seconds ago isn't on fire right now. There's the tradeoff - reliability
  versus speed. If you have a large cached check horizon, you risk having unreliable check result values being used in the
  monitoring logic.</p>

  <p>Icinga will eventually determine the correct state of all hosts and services, so even if cached check results prove
  to unreliably represent their true value, Icinga will only work with incorrect information for a short period of time.
  Even short periods of unreliable status information can prove to be a nuisance for admins, as they may receive notifications
  about problems which no longer exist.</p>

  <p>There is no standard cached check horizon or cache hit rate that will be acceptable to every Icinga users. Some
  people will want a short horizon timeframe and a low cache hit rate, while others will want a larger horizon timeframe and a
  larger cache hit rate (with a low reliability rate). Some users may even want to disable cached checks altogether to obtain a
  100% reliability rate. Testing different horizon timeframes, and their effect on the reliability of status information, is the
  only want that an individual user will find the "right" value for their situation. More information on this is discussed
  below.</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Configuration Variables</strong></span></p>

  <p>The following variables determine the timeframes in which a previous host or service check result may be used as a cached
  host or service check result:</p>

  <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
      <p>The <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-cached_host_check_horizon">cached_host_check_horizon</a> variable controls cached
      host checks.</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>The <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-cached_service_check_horizon">cached_service_check_horizon</a> variable controls
      cached service checks.</p>
    </li>
</ul></div>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Optimizing Cache Effectiveness</strong></span></p>

  <p>In order to make the most effective use of cached checks, you should:</p>

  <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
      <p>Schedule regular checks of your hosts</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>Use MRTG to graph statistics for 1) on-demand checks and 2) cached checks</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>Adjust cached check horizon variables to fit your needs</p>
    </li>
</ul></div>

  <p>You can schedule regular checks of your hosts by specifying a value greater than 0 for <span class="emphasis"><em>check_interval</em></span>
  option in your <a class="link" href="objectdefinitions.html#objectdefinitions-host">host definitions</a>. If you do this, make sure that you set the
  <span class="emphasis"><em>max_check_attempts</em></span> option to a value greater than 1, or it will cause a big performance hit. This potential
  performance hit is describe in detail <a class="link" href="hostchecks.html" title="Host Checks">here</a>.</p>

  <p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/cachedcheckgraphs.png"></span></p>

  <p>A good way to determine the proper value for the cached check horizon options is to compare how many on-demand checks
  Icinga has to actually run versus how may it can use cached values for. The <a class="link" href="icingastats.html" title="Using The Icingastats Utility">icingastats</a> utility can produce information on cached checks, which can then be <a class="link" href="mrtggraphs.html" title="Graphing Performance Info With MRTG">graphed with MRTG</a>. Example MRTG graphs that show cached vs. actual on-demand checks are shown to the
  right.</p>

  <p>The monitoring installation which produced the graphs above had:</p>

  <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
      <p>A total of 44 hosts, all of which were checked at regular intervals</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>An average (regularly scheduled) host check interval of 5 minutes</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>A <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-cached_host_check_horizon">cached_host_check_horizon</a> of 15 seconds</p>
    </li>
</ul></div>

  <p>The first MRTG graph shows how many regularly scheduled host checks compared to how many cached host checks have occured.
  In this example, an average of 53 host checks occur every five minutes. 9 of these (17%) are on-demand checks.</p>

  <p>The second MRTG graph shows how many cached host checks have occurred over time. In this example an average of 2 cached
  host checks occurs every five minutes.</p>

  <p>Remember, cached checks are only available for on-demand checks. Based on the 5 minute averages from the graphs, we see
  that Icinga is able to used cached host check results every 2 out of 9 times an on-demand check has to be run. That may
  not seem much, but these graphs represent a small monitoring environment. Consider that 2 out of 9 is 22% and you can start to
  see how this could significantly help improve host check performance in large environments. That percentage could be higher if
  the cached host check horizon variable value was increased, but that would reduce the reliability of the cached host state
  information.</p>

  <p>Once you've had a few hours or days worth of MRTG graphs, you should see how many host and service checks were done by
  executing plugins versus those that used cached check results. Use that information to adjust the cached check horizon variables
  appropriately for your situation. Continue to monitor the MRTG graphs over time to see how changing the horizon variables
  affected cached check statistics. Rinse and repeat as necessary.</p>
