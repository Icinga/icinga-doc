  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></p>

  <p>There are a few things you can do that can decrease the amount of time it take Icinga to startup (or restart).
  These speedups involve easing some of the burden involved in processing your configuration files.</p>

  <p>Using these techniques is particularly useful when you have one or more of the following:</p>

  <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
      <p>Large configurations</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>Complex configurations (heavy use of template features)</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>Installations where frequest restarts are necessary</p>
    </li>
</ul></div>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Background</strong></span></p>

  <p>Whenever Icinga starts/restarts it has to process your configuration files before it can get down to the business
  of monitoring. This configuration startup process involves a number of steps:</p>

  <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
      <p>Reading the config files</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>Resolving template definitions</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>"Recombobulating" your objects (my term for the various types of work that occurs)</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>Duplicating object definitions</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>Inheriting object properties</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>Sorting your object definitions</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>Verifying object relationship integrity</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>Checking for circular paths</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>and more...</p>
    </li>
</ul></div>

  <p>Some of these steps can be quite time-consuming when you have large or complex configurations. Is there a way to speed any
  of these steps up? Yes!</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Evaluating Startup Times</strong></span></p>

  <p>Before we get on to making things faster, we need to see what's possible and whether or not we should even bother with the
  whole thing. This is easy to do - simply start Icinga with the <span class="bold"><strong>-s</strong></span> command line switch to
  get timing and scheduling information.</p>

  <p>An example of the output (abbreviated to only show relevant portions) is shown below. For this example, we're using an
  Icinga config that has 25 hosts defined and just over 10,000 services.</p>

Timing information on object configuration processing is listed
below.  You can use this information to see if precaching your
object configuration would be useful.

Timing information on configuration verification is listed below.

CONFIG VERIFICATION TIMES          (* = Potential for speedup with -x option)
----------------------------------
Object Relationships: 1.400807 sec
Circular Paths:       54.676622 sec  *
Misc:                 0.006924 sec
                      ============
TOTAL:                56.084353 sec  * = 54.676622 sec (97.5%) estimated savings</pre>

  <p>Okay, let's see what happened. Looking at the totals, it took roughly <span class="bold"><strong>11.6</strong></span> seconds to
  process the configuration files and another <span class="bold"><strong>56</strong></span> seconds to verify the config. That means that
  every time we start or restart Icinga with this configuration, it will take nearly <span class="bold"><strong>68
  seconds</strong></span> of startup work before it can monitor anything! That's not acceptable if we have to restart Icinga on
  a semi-regular basis.</p>

  <p>What can we do about this? Take another look at the output and you'll see that Icinga estimates that we could save
  about <span class="bold"><strong>8.4</strong></span> seconds off the configuration processing time and another <span class="bold"><strong>54.7</strong></span> off the verification times. In total, Icinga thinks we could save <span class="bold"><strong>63
  seconds</strong></span> of the normal startup time if some optimizations were taken.</p>

  <p>Whoa! From <span class="bold"><strong>68 seconds</strong></span> to just <span class="bold"><strong>5 seconds</strong></span>? Yep, read on
  for how to do it.</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Pre-Caching Object Configuration</strong></span></p>

  <p>Icinga can spend quite a bit of time parsing your config files, especially if you make use of the template features
  such as inheritance, etc. In order to reduce the time it takes to parse your config, you can have Icinga pre-process and
  pre-cache your config files for future use.</p>

  <div class="informaltable">
    <table border="0">
<colgroup>
<col>
<col>
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<p> When you run Icinga with the <span class="bold"><strong>-p</strong></span> command
          line option, Icinga will read your config files in, process them, and save them to a pre-cached object config
          file (specified by the <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-precached_object_file">precached_object_file</a> directive). This
          pre-cached config file will contain pre-processed configuration entries that are easier/faster for Icinga to
          process in the future.</p> <p>You must use the <span class="bold"><strong>-p</strong></span> command line option along with
          either the <span class="bold"><strong>-v</strong></span> or <span class="bold"><strong>-s</strong></span> command line options, as shown
          below. This ensures that your configuration is verified before the precached file is created.</p> <pre class="screen"> /usr/local/icinga/bin/icinga -pv /usr/local/icinga/etc/icinga.cfg </pre>
          <p>The size of your precached config file will most likely be significantly larger than the sum of the sizes of your
          object config files. This is normal and by design.</p>
</td>
<td align="left" valign="top"><p> <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/fast-startup1.png"></span> </p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<p> Once the precached object configuration file have been created, you can start
          Icinga and tell it to use the precached config file instead of your object config file(s) by using the <span class="bold"><strong>-u</strong></span> command line option.</p> <pre class="screen"> /usr/local/icinga/bin/icinga -ud /usr/local/icinga/etc/icinga.cfg </pre>
          <p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/important.gif"></span> If you modify your configuration files, you will need to re-verify and re-cache your
          configuration files before restarting Icinga. If you don't re-generate the precached object file, Icinga
          will continue to use your old configuration because it is now reading from the precached file, rather than your source
          configuration files.</p>

<td align="left" valign="top"><p> <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/fast-startup2.png"></span> </p></td>

  </div>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Skipping Circular Path Tests</strong></span></p>

  <p>The second (and most time-intensive) portion of the configuration startup phase is the circular path check. In the example
  above, it took nearly a minute to perform this step of the configuration verification.</p>

  <p>What is the circular path check and why does it take so long? The circular patch check is designed to ensure that you
  don't define any circular paths in your host, host dependency, or service dependency definitions. If a circular path existed in
  your config files, Icinga could end up in a deadlock situation. The most likely reason for the check taking so long is
  that we're not using an efficient algorithm. A much more efficient algorithm for detecting circular paths would be most
  welcomed. Hint: That means all you CompSci graduate students who have been emailing me about doing your thesis on Icinga
  can contribute some code back. :-)</p>

  <p>If you want to skip the circular path check when Icinga starts, you can add the -x command line option like
  this:</p>

  <pre class="screen"> /usr/local/icinga/bin/icinga -xd /usr/local/icinga/etc/icinga.cfg </pre>

  <p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/important.gif"></span> It is of utmost importance that you verify your configuration before starting/restarting Icinga
  when skipping circular path checks. Failure to do so could lead to deadlocks in the Icinga logic. You have been
  warned.</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Putting It All Together</strong></span></p>

  <p>Follow these steps if you want to make use of potential speedups from pre-caching your configuration and skipping circular
  path checks.</p>

  <p>1. Verify your configuration and create the precache file with the following command:</p>

  <pre class="screen"> /usr/local/icinga/bin/icinga -vp /usr/local/icinga/etc/icinga.cfg </pre>

  <p>2. Stop Icinga if it is currently running.</p>

  <p>3. Start Icinga like so to use the precached config file and skip circular path checks:</p>

  <pre class="screen"> /usr/local/icinga/bin/icinga -uxd /usr/local/icinga/etc/icinga.cfg </pre>

  <p>4. When you modify your original configuration files in the future and need to restart Icinga to make those changes
  take place, repeat step 1 to re-verify your config and regenerate your cached config file. Once that is done you can restart
  Icinga through the web interface or by sending a SIGHUP signal. If you don't re-generate the precached object file,
  Icinga will continue to use your old confguration because it is now reading from the precached file, rather than your
  source configuration files.</p>

  <p>5. That's it! Enjoy the increased startup speed.</p>
